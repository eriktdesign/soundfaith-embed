# SoundFaith Embed

A WordPress plugin for automatic embedding of content from SoundFaith.com

## Description

SoundFaith.com is a great site to host your recorded sermons, especially when used with the Proclaim presentation software. The plugin allow you to easily embed individual sermons or a playlist of sermons on your WordPress website without using any code.

## Usage

### Share an individual sermon

1. Copy the URL from your sermon on SoundFaith.com, eg: <https://soundfaith.com/sermons/168128-god-so-loved-the-world>
2. Edit the post or page where you want to embed the sermon.
3. Paste the URL on a line by itself in the editor.
4. Presto! The URL will turn into an embedded player for your sermon.

### Share a playlist

1. Copy the URL of your SoundFaith profile page
2. Edit the post or page where you want to embed the playlist
3. Paste the URL on a line by itself in the editor.
4. Another presto! Your URL will turn into the most recent sermons playlist.

## Settings

The plugin settings page under _Settings->SoundFaith Embed_ contains the same settings available under the "Embed" dialog on SoundFaith.com

### Sermon Embed Settings

1. **Show sermon details** shows the sermon Title, Speaker Name, Series Name, Date, Rating and a download link under the sermon.

### Profile Embed Settings

1. **Show sermon details**
2. **Show thumbnail in playlist**
3. **Show speaker name in playlist**
4. **Show series name in playlist**
5. **Show sermon date in playlist**

### Content Width

The embedded player size is calculated with your theme's `$content_width` variable. If your theme doesn't have this set, the embed will default to 600px wide. [Learn more in the Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Width).

I have no affiliation with SoundFaith or Faithlife. I released this plugin because I needed it. Enjoy!
